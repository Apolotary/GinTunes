---GinTunes (pre-alpha ver.)---

++Description++

This is a simple playlist manager, which allows you
to create, store and remove your own playlists, 
artists, albums, tracks and many other things you may
want to use in your music library.

++Known Issues and Troubleshooting++

This is a very first release, so it's a very glitchy and
extremely error-prone application. You will probably meet with
many weird errors (which are mostly derived from "friendly"
Castle AR methods), seeing a message box with "Whoops! Something
bad has happened =(" text every time the application is in trouble.

Unfortunately, it doesn't support real files with paths and
sorting result records in some kind of order is also not 
available right now.

<<Bugs and Errors>>

You will most likely have an error when program encounters 
empty fields or empty records in database. Therefore, please
DO NOT REMOVE INITIAL TEST RECORDS. Otherwise, the application
will have a highly unpredictable behavior. Also, please don't 
remove all the records you have for artist/ album/ etc.

Handwritten text in combo boxes will probably lead to an unknown 
error. If you want to add something to combobox, please use an
appropriate adding form first and then choose newly added records
from the box.

If you want to refresh boxes after you added/ deleted something, 
please press the home button first and then choose the appropriate
form again.

<<Things you should also know before starting>>

Deleting a genre, year, artist, any other record except track
will lead to removal of ALL records connected with this record.
For instance, if you delete year 2008, then ALL artists with
albums and tracks connected with this year will be deleted.

That's all for now. We hope you'll enjoy using this application.
