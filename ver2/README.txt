---GinTunes (pre-alpha ver. 2)---

++Description++

This is a simple playlist manager, which allows you
to create, store and remove your own playlists, 
artists, albums, tracks and many other things you may
want to use in your music library.

++Known Issues and Troubleshooting++

So, this is the second release of this application. It
has (partially) implemented MVP approach, which makes 
the source code slightly more reusable. However, rewriting
this application in MVP-way has added additional bugs and
it'd most likely force application to crash. 

Although, our one-man development team hasn't discovered 
any problems yet, it's higly recommended to remember
about precautions from older version of README.txt.

Also you might notice that:

- Code now is a bit more readable and, probably, faster.

- Unfortunately almost all classes were set to public.
  This was caused by weird "inconsistent accessibility"
  exception in VS.

That's all for now. We hope you'll enjoy using this application.
